### Prerequisites

- Node.js (use NVM to install)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-assignment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

3. Configure Tailwind CSS:
   Ensure that Tailwind CSS is properly set up in your project by following the installation guide on the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Components

- **Header**: Displays the title of the application.
- **Profile**: Accepts `name` and `email` as props and displays user details.
- **Counter**: Manages a count state and provides buttons to increment the count.

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can modify the styles by adding or changing the utility classes in the component files.

### Testing

Ensure that all components are working as expected by checking the console for any errors or warnings.
